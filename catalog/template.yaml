# This catalog is used for testing OLM deployment outside of the OperatorHub
# community catalog. You should only use this catalog for validating OLM
# bundles and for testing OLM upgrades against an OpenShift cluster.
#
# $VERSION and $BUNDLE_IMG will be replaced by `make catalog-build`
#
# If you want to test upgrading, replace this file's contents with an
# uncommented copy of this (replace bundle image and versions, can't do that
# automatically):
